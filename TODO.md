# TODO
## Just a simple markdown file to see what I have to do

### Talk with UX team
- About arrows in the recipe#show (why ? to navigate in random recipes, same cities, by date order ?)
- What about recipe#show responsive ????
- What about City Gallery ? What's the good cards ? How should it be open ?

### Reorganize DB
- For recipe/ingredients : it should be a list
- For recipe/recipe : it should have multiple paragraphs

### Nota benne (WOW, I SPEAK LATIN)
- Don't forget to import fonts
- Make a default image for when it's missing
